Explain why -100 is the result most of the time when executing fix_counter.c originally without changing anything?

Since pthread_create() would create thread with shared memory (without stack part), the offset may therefore be changed to -1 while the first created thread did not enter the for loop yet, leading to both thread 2 running faster and complete faster that provides negative numbers.
