Explain why -100 is the result most of the time when executing fix_counter.c originally without changing anything?

Since clone() is used to implement the pthread_create(), where the threads will share the same mm_struct which contain code and data segment (virtual memory, file system, open files, shared memory and signal handlers with the parent thread/process are shared), the offset may therefore be changed to -1 while the first created thread did not enter the for loop yet, leading to both threads running the for loop for adding to counter 50 times with offset = -1. Of course, sometimes the first thread created may run faster and entered the for loop already and run a random amount of times for adding to counter with offset = 1, which may lead to having some of the results not equal to -100, but given that the runtime required for running N = 50 times of for loop in each thread is very quick, therefore most of the results obtained will be -100.
